// You will be making your first musical instrument! Music apps are so popular on the App Store that they even get their own category. So in this module, weâ€™re going to make a colourful XyloPhone app. Get it? Ok, the jokes are bad, but remember, I only wrote the good ones... 

import UIKit
import AVFoundation

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    var player: AVAudioPlayer!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }

    @IBAction func keyPressed(_ sender:
        UIButton) {
        sender.alpha = 0.5
        
        playSound(soundName: sender.currentTitle!)
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.2){
           
                  sender.alpha = 1.0
            
        }
        
      
    }
    
     
    
    func playSound(soundName: String) {
        let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: soundName, withExtension: "wav")
        player = try! AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: url!)
        player.play()
                
    }
}
