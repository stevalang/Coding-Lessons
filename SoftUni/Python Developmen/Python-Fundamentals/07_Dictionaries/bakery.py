SUPyF2 Dictionaries-Lab - 01. Bakery
Problem:
This is your first task in your new job.
You were tasked to create a list of the stock in a bakery and you really don't want to fail at you first day at work.
You will receive a single line containing some food (keys) and quantities (values).
They will be separated by a single space (the first element is the key, the second â€“ the value and so on).
Create a dictionary with all the keys and values and print it on the console
Examples:
Input:                              	Output:
bread 10 butter 4 sugar 9 jam 12	    {'bread': 10, 'butter': 4, 'sugar': 9, 'jam': 12}
