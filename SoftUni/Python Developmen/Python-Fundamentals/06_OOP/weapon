"""
Create a class Weapon. The __init__ method should receive an amount of bullets (integer). Create an attribute called bullets, to store them. The class should also have the following methods:
shoot() - if there are bullets in the weapon, reduce them by 1 and return a message "shootingâ€¦". If there are no bullets left, return: "no bullets left".
You should also override the toString method, so that the following code: print(weapon) should work. To do that define a __repr__ method that returns "Remaining bullets: {amount_of_bullets}". You can read more about the __repr__ method here: link
